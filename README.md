Hey there, I’m Modiri! I’m a software development student with a big interest in tech, especially cybersecurity. Even though I'm new to the game, I've got a good understanding of the basics of coding and I'm stoked to keep expanding my skills and knowledge in the field. I’m eager to learn all about the newest trends, and maybe even try my hand at some cybersecurity projects in the future!

While I'm currently a student, my long-term goal is to switch gears and focus on cybersecurity. As a cybersecurity professional, I want to use my coding skills and problem-solving abilities to protect important data and systems from cyber attacks.

When I’m not geeking out over code, I’m usually getting my sweat on at the gym, hiking through nature, or catching a flick at the movie theater. I love staying active and exploring the outdoors, and movie nights are a great way to unwind and escape into a different world for a while.
